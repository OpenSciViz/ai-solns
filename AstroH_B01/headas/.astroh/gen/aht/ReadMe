Build 0.0 Release notes and ReadMe

Please note that AstroH_B00 (build 0) 'aht' command-line arg. handling is very simple-minded,
and only one option at a time is properly handled -- bundling aka 'aht -dehinpstuv ...'
will recognize -d and ignore the rest!

Also note that while Perl provides excellent support for running child procs., its ability
to detect a coredump is hampered if one's shell 'coredumpsize' value is 0 In the event
of a child coredump, the observed exit status of the child is always 0 -- but if there
is no coredump file created, Perl will not detect that the child exited abnormally.

Finally, the exit status of 'aht' itself is 0 if the detected exit status of the child is congruent
with the expected value indicated in the test manifest (0 or not) -- otherwise aht's exit value is
set to that of the child proc's.

----------------------------------------------------

Aht is a Perl script meant to support unit test during development, and for acceptance and regression 
testing of the Astro-H FITS tool (Ftool) binary apps. The Astro-H Ftool app. developer establishes
test input(s) and runs the tool app. manually to produce output. A manifest text file -- implemented as 
a Perl hash statement -- indicates the nature and specifics of a unit test. The Astro-H test Perl 
script (aht) executes the Ftool app. as a child proc., once expected output has been established
('aht -u' copies successful output to the special sub-directory './expected_output/'). All Ftool app. 
printout to stdout and stderr are redirected by aht to text log files. The user may interrupt an aht 
test via Control-C (interrupt signal). Aht monitors child proc. signals to determine if the Ftool app.
completes execution successfully or fails, and reports its exit value. Upon a successful exit value, aht 
compares/validates output with what is expected. On unsuccessful exit value, aht searches logs for keywords 
(described in the manifest) and reports accordingly.

The aht manifest file is a Perl hash statement of key => values that is initialized by aht in the current
working directory -- ./aht_manifest.pl. It is evaluated by aht to conduct the indicated test and some
aht options update/reset its contents. The manifest may be edited (carefully) to customize the unit test.
In particular, the key 'final' => 'true' is an indication that subsequent updates should not reset the
associated hash element.

Aht establishes the child (ftool) runtime environment by processing a setup.sh script that it initializes
under the current working directory -- ./etc/setup.sh. This script default is simply generated from a Perl
'Here' statement, and can/should be edited by the developer. It sets a number of environment variables by 
first sourcing the standard HEADAS init script (. ${HEADAS}/headas-init.sh), then optionally reseting
selected items as required for development and test activities. The manifest provides a key => value
for the path/file-name of the setup script.

------------------------------------------------------

There are currently 9 Perl modules (AH::) in the aht design implementation that export
the globals and functions listed below. The aht script itself is simply an entry mechanism
into AH::UTInvoke::utmain(), and currently uses a hard-coded manifest file: './aht_manifest.pl'.

AH::UTEnv exports global variable: $SysPFILES
AH::UTEnv exports functions: cshSetup shSetup setupEnv)

AH::UTExec exports global variables: $ChildPID $TimeOut $ToolRunTimeDir $ToolOutlog $ToolErrlog
AH::UTExec exports functions: conductTest runTool execChild validChild watchFolders watchFiles

AH::UTValidate exports functions: searchKeywords validate validateText validateFITS validateAncil md5Check

----------------------------------------------------------

The developer sets up empty test area ('aht.pl -i' may assist with this) and (optionally) customizes an initialization
script that sets up the test environment (e.g. setup.sh for a Tool-specific CALDB set-up).
The developer creates/copies test input data into location for input data as specified by the File/Directory Convention.
The developer runs the Tool by hand, specifying input parameters on the command line. Parameters shall locate input a
nd output data files according to the File/Directory Convention.
The developer inspects, verifies and validates the output to ensure the Tool output is correct, then runs the Tool Test
(aht) in 'update' mode. 
The developer must specify the name of the Tool and the expected exit status. The update mode uses the File/Directory 
Convention to locate and copy all current inputs and outputs to their reference locations.
In the infrequent case where the output parameter file is different from the input parameter file, it may be necessary
to restore the input parameter file by hand.

Usage: aht [Arguments] 

For example, "aht -h" prints this (build 0.0) brief cmd-line synopses:
aht> verbose describe == verbose: -v[v] or [-]-[very]verbose print verbose dscription of runtime test activities.
aht> tooltest describe == tooltest: -t or [-]-tool or [-]-toolname [ftool name] binary executable of test -- ftool cmdline options
aht> env describe == env: -e or [-]-env print runtime environment of test.
aht> noop describe == noop: -n or [-]-noop [ftool name] print runtime execution info.
aht> init describe == init: -i or [-]-init [ftool name] initialize filesystem and create working manifest, and implicit update if possible.
aht> manifest describe == manifest: -m indicate manifest-file of test
aht> help describe == help: -h or or [-]-help synopsis and related info.
aht> debug describe == debug: -d or [-]-debug [ftool name] exec gdb debugger on current tool binary.
aht> update describe == update: -u or [-]-update [ftool name] recursively copy latest -- good -- test results from runtime ./output subdir to ./expected_output.
aht> filesys describe == filesys: -f filesystem info. used by init and for runtime test
aht> param describe == param: -p or [-]-par [ftool name] print runtime tool parameter info.

Arguments that have evolved as result of prototype:

Was : [ -n | --name tool-name ]: name of Tool to run for this Tool Test (needed only with -u)
Changed (due to -noop ambiguity): [-t | --tool | --toolname whatever ]: name of Tool to run for this Tool Test.
Prototype behavior: Manifest file is updated with new tool name and test is attempted.

Was: [ -t | --text test-case-hint ]: cryptic test description (needed only with -u)
Changed (due to above change): [  -i | --init test-case-hint/header ]: cryptic test description 

Was: [ Tool Arguments ]: arguments valid for the Tool being tested.
Changed (for syntax clarity): [ -- Tool Arguments ]: arguments valid for the Tool being tested.

Arguments: 

[ -- Tool Arguments ]: arguments valid for the Tool being tested.
Prototype behavior: parses all the text following the '--' and inserts as-is into the manifest.

[ -d | --debug ]: set up the test environment and then start the Ftool app. binary in the gdb debugger
Prototype behavior: execs gdb, but currenlty there is no '~/.gdbinit'.

[ -e | --env ]: display all environment variables as set prior to executing the Tool
Prototype behavior: mostly cleaned-up.

[ -h | --help ]: display help and exit
Prototype behavior: prints this Synopsis.

[ -i | --init test-case-hint/header ]: cryptic test description 
Prototype behavior: manifest file is initialized with optional text header, if provided in cmd-line.

[ -n | --noop ]: display the command that would be executed if the Tool ran but do not actually run the Tool
Prototype behavior: mostly cleaned-up.

[ -s | --status expected-status ]: integer value expected when the Tool exits (needed only with -u)
Prototype behavior: manifest file updated with default and list (valvec) values.

[-t | --tool | --toolname whatever ]: name of Tool to run for this Tool Test.
Prototype behavior: manifest file is updated with new tool name (if provided). Test is conducted. Exit status is checked
                    and unsuccessful tests are partially handled (keyword seach is TBD). Successfull test
                    validation is TBD.

[ -u | --update ]: replace the contents of the output-expected subdirectory with the current files in the output
                   subdir ectory; used when the expected behavior of the tool changed, and the new output has been
                   validated by the developer. This option will also update the inventory of input and expected 
                   output in the Manifest file.
Prototype behavior: all ouputs found are replicated to ./expected_output/... and manifest file content inventory is (re)set.

[ -p | --par ]: display all parameter values as set prior to executing the Tool
Prototype behavior: simply invokes the standard Ftool 'plist' via perl backtick and prints to stdout.

Generic Tool Test (aht.pl) Example invocations:

Example 1: create (update) a test case for ftlist; just display summary of file:
design-spec.: aht --name ahdemo --status=0 --text display-file-summary --update  infile=./input/ftlist.fits  option=HK
build 0 prototype: aht -i[--init] 'test header info'
or         aht -t[--test/tool] ahdemo  -- option=HK 
or         aht -u[--update] ahdemo -s 0

Example 2: run this test case, which was already set up (in the current manifest):
design-spec.: aht
build 0 prototype: aht -t

Example 2: print test case scenario described in the current manifest, doing everythong short of running the ftool app. (so-called no-operation):
build 0 prototype: aht -n[--noop] 

Example 4: debug this test case, which was already set up:
build 0 protoype: aht.pl -d[--debug]

Example 5: run this test case, which was already set up, but display all information about the test environment and parameter input:
build 0 prototype: aht.pl -p[--par] -e[--env]

---------------------------------------------------------

Directory and File Conventions
Run-time Directory: the actual test command required by any Tool Test shall be executed in the output subdirectory of the unit test directory
Input Parameter File:
The input parameter file shall cause all input data to be taken from the input subdirectory of the unit test directory.
The input parameter file shall cause all output data to be written to the output subdirectory of the unit test directory.

Astro-H Analysis System Architecture
HEASARC Build System (hmake tool, standard Makefiles)
Typical GNU build pattern: configure, make, make install
Hmake tool supports full system build and installation
Hmake also supports build/installation of  individual components
Makefiles are simple; use standard patterns
Standard targets supported: all, default, install, test, clean, distclean
Staged installation:
Hmake (build step): for each component (library/tool):
First build, then install in BLD (staged area)
Libraries and their public headers are gathered in one place
Hmake install (installation step): for each component (library/tool):
Put files in target location
Location can be set by configure using --prefix
this is under construction...

Reformatting and Calibration Algorithm Attributes:
Define Record as one row of data in only the columns of interest
Example: suppose the FITS file has columns TIME, ENERGY, RA, DEC, THETA, PHI, and ZENITH_ANGLE. Assume only RA and DEC
are relevant for a given algorithm. The Record in this case would be { RA, DEC }.
Required: a generic way to specify the contents of a Record, i.e., which columns are to be read.

Row-based Algorithm Specification
A row in a FITS table has data {x1, x2, ..., xn}
An algorithm is an operation f(R), where R is a Record
