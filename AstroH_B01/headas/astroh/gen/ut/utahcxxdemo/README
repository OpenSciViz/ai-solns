This directory contains the aht-driven unit test for utahcxxdemo.

Please check aht.pl is installed and in the PATH via `which aht.pl`
If it is, consider setting a sym-link abbreviation for it via:
ln -s `which aht.pl` aht
in this working directory and start/init the unit test activity via:

aht -i 

Currently the 'aht.pl -i' places a reference aht_manifest.pl in this
working directory (./) and provides intial versions of
./etc/{setup.sh,setup.csh}

To actually start running & testing things, first

source ./etc/setup.csh
or 
. ./etc/setup.sh

The above can/should be edit/customized by the developer,
and note that it (re)sets a number of env. variables including
HEADAS and PFILES.

Also note 'aht.pl -i' will cp $PFILES/whatever.par to ./input/ 

One may find some sample inptu FITS files and cp them here:

cp -p ../../../gen/lib/astroh/src/test/input/[Re]* input

So try:

aht.pl -i
aht.pl -e
aht.pl -n
aht.pl -t
aht.pl -u

and retest the updates via
aht.pl -t
