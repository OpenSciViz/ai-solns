Makefile and C function stubs and (pure) Python partial implementation.
Also some SWIG boilerplate, allowing C code to be used/tested as a Python module.

As (pure) Python implementation becomes mature/complete, port to C and test and compare.
Python code should be C-like (no classes/objects, with minimal Python Zen).

# ai-solns from JP:
For the take-home coding challenge, Id like you to take a look at the following problem: https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/17

Please solve the problem using C and send your source code and instructions for compiling it.

If youre unfamiliar, Advent of Code is a yearly programming puzzle challenge that posts a new challenge every day from December 1st to December 25th since its start in 2015.

Registration is free and since the creator is a friend of mine I can assure you he doesnt use your email for spam or any other annoying purpose. If youd prefer not to make an account just let me know and Id be happy to send you a specific puzzle input.

Please do not spend a large amount of time on this. Ive been in your position before and I want to make sure Im respecting your time. So if you find yourself a couple hours into the challenge with significant work left to do, please just send what you have. And please dont feel like this needs to be completed immediately. A few days is totally fine.

When you solve the prompt there is a second part that you are welcome to try, but today Im just asking you to take a look at part 1.

Hopefully you find it interesting!

Thanks,

JP
